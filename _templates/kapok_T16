There are 2 relays for the outlets and relay3i (blue light) and relay41 (yellow light) for the 2 led on the button. 

Rule for on/off button press requires SUPPORT_IF_STATEMENT update 

```console
Rule1 on BUTTON1#STATE=2 do if (var1!=1) power1 1; power2 1; var1 1 ELSE power1 0; power2 0; var1 0 endif endon
```
